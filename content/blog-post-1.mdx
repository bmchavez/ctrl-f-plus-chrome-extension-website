## What is a Promise?

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let condition = true;

  if (condition) {
    resolve('Promise is resolved!');
  } else {
    reject('Promise is rejected!');
  }
});
```

## Promise Methods

Promises include several methods, two of the most used ones are `.then()` and `.catch()`.

### .then()

The `.then()` method is used with a Promise to specify what should happen when the Promise is resolved.

```javascript
promise
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

### .catch()

The `.catch()` method is used with a Promise to specify what should happen if the Promise is rejected.

```javascript
promise
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Error:', error));
```

Ut tempus urna at massa semper aliquam. Phasellus faucibus nunc non interdum consequat.

## Conclusion

Promises are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow you to work with asynchronous operations more comfortably. Understanding how they work can help you write more effective and clean JavaScript code.

```javascript
console.log('Happy coding!');
```
