For the search animation/effect, can you make the text reactive to the mouse hover of the "green" shape i.e the text should look whitish-green/light shade of green  when any part of the green svg touches it.



Can you make the parallax card at the bottom have a fade-in-up animation



Can you add fade-in-up animations to other sections of the website e,g blog and team page, that way page navigation transitions do not appear jarring
