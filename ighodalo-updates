·         About Page:

o   Let me know if you have any other thoughts or suggestions on this page, specifically regarding the fonts, font colors, and/or overall spacing.

not sure if you have any plans for the About section i.e copy, but i think you can just change the title in the nav to "Team"  and take out the about section

Also, you will have to remove that margin that's indenting the "our team" container.



·         Misc.

o   I worked on the updates from our last meeting. Let me know if anything still needs tweaking.

For the search animation/effect, can you make the text reactive to the mouse hover of the "green" shape i.e the text should look whitish-green/light shade of green  when any part of the green svg touches it.



Can you make the parallax card at the bottom have a fade-in-up animation



Can you add fade-in-up animations to other sections of the website e,g blog and team page, that way page navigation transitions do not appear jarring
